## Assignment 1

Abe, this is an good topic for this course. I think if you could dig into the concept of eletroluminesence a bit more from the physics standpoint that would align very well with the spirit of the project. The specifics of the LED technology and the design of different LEDs is a good way to broaden the paper, but I think you will need to unpack the phenomenon of eletroluminesence to get there. My suggestion would be to read a paper on this phenomenon as well as one of your proposed LED papers - probably the Grandjean or Gayral article as both appear pretty readable for a first foray. For eletroluminesence, I wonder if this article by Koshida and Koyama (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.106652) would be ok or perhaps one it's references. In any event, I think getting some background on the underlying phenomenon will be important.

* Score: 20/20
