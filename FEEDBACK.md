# Feedback on Project Work
## Abe Yeck

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 5

Abe, excellent paper. The structure and writing are very good so far. Soldier on, good sir.

* Score: 20/20

## Assignment 4

Abe, this is an excellent start to your paper. I have two pieces of feedback that I'm hoping you can take forward into the next piece of work you complete. (1) In discusssing the models that you are using to describe the LEDs, make sure not to just describe the variables in the equations, but the relationships and underlying physics that gives rise to the model. You can do that conceptually without a ton of detail, but it's a key part to describing what you are doing. And (2) there's parts of your writeup that are a little less professionally written and parts that are a bit more. For example, the first two paragraphs are written well and at the right professional level, so try to model the rest of your writing on that level. Great job!

## Assignment 3

Abe, these summaries do a good job of presenting the major model equations in the papers that you read, so thanks for reading and reacting to the feedback. It does appear that these model equations are a bit more "practical" in the sense that the provide model information on the LED output. I'm curious how this relates to electroluminesence and how you will tie those things together in your paper. It would be fine to focus on either the practical side or the more theoretical side. If you want to bring them together, that would be excellent.

## Assignment 2

Abe, these are nice summaries of the articles that you read this week. They seem to have been at the right level of depth for you, but I feel like I'm missing the understanding of the modeling of LEDs. That is, for this project it would be good to know more about the physics of electroluminesence and how people make models of it. So, while you are doing a good job of reading appropriate articles and summarizing them, I think it will be important to dig a little into the mathematics surroduing models of LEDs and how those tie to what you are discussing.

## Assignment 1

Abe, this is an good topic for this course. I think if you could dig into the concept of electroluminesence a bit more from the physics standpoint that would align very well with the spirit of the project. The specifics of the LED technology and the design of different LEDs is a good way to broaden the paper, but I think you will need to unpack the phenomenon of eletroluminesence to get there. My suggestion would be to read a paper on this phenomenon as well as one of your proposed LED papers - probably the Grandjean or Gayral article as both appear pretty readable for a first foray. For eletroluminesence, I wonder if this article by Koshida and Koyama (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.106652) would be ok or perhaps one it's references. In any event, I think getting some background on the underlying phenomenon will be important.
